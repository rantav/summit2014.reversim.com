{"_id":"79udskXhConjo3sYa","abstract":"This talk presents an event-driven approach for the separation of concerns in software systems. We introduce the EventJ framework that provides an event-driven extension to the Java programming language. We describe a general methodology that can be used to identify the cross-cutting concerns and separate them from the main functionality using events and event handlers. We discuss the pre-requisites to perform this change and illustrate it with a concrete example. Finally, we make a comparison between the event-driven approach and the aspect-oriented one, and conclude that the use of events to separate concerns has a positive effect on software quality attributes such as maintainability, extensibility and reusability. The talk includes several real-code examples using both EventJ and AspectJ.

{"_id":"E7NMSECJku5kxMbQp","abstract":"Friday 4th June 1976, the Sex Pistols kicked off their first gig, a gig that's considered to change western music culture forever, pioneering the genesis of punk rock.\n\nWednesday 19th July 2000 had a similar impact on internet scale companies as the Sex Pistols did on music, with the keynote speech by Eric Brewer at the ACM symposium on the [Principles of Distributed Computing](http://www.podc.org/podc2000/) (PODC). Eric Brewer claimed that as applications become more web-based we should stop worrying about data consistency, because if we want high availability in those new distributed applications, then we cannot have data consistency. Two years later, in 2002, Seth Gilbert and Nancy Lynch [formally proved](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.20.1495\u0026rep=rep1\u0026type=pdf) Brewer's claim as what is known today as the Brewer's Theorem or CAP.\n\nThe CAP theorem mandates that a distributed system cannot satisfy both Consistency, Availability and Partition tolerance. In the database ecosystem, many tools claim to solve our data persistence problems while scaling out, offering different capabilities (document stores, key/values, SQL, graph, etc).\n\nIn this talk we will explore the CAP theorem \n\n+ We will define what are Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance \n+ We will explore what CAP means for our applications (ACID vs BASE)\n+ We will explore practical applications on MySQL with read slave, MongoDB and Riak based on the work by [Aphyr - Kyle Kingsbury](http://aphyr.com/posts).

The bad news are that in the last decade the computing power of single threaded application remains almost flat. \nIf you decide to continue  ignoring concurrency and multi-threading the gap between the problems you are able to solve and your hardware capabilities will continue to rise. In this session we will discuss different approaches for taming the concurrency beast, such as shared mutability,shared immutability and isolated mutability actors, STM, etc we will discuss the shortcomings and the dangers of each approach and we will compare different programming languages and how they choose to tackle/ignore concurrency.

You can write perfect code and spend sleepless nights ensuring 100% tests coverage, but you'll always be exposed to environmental issues, creative users and just plain bad luck.

We will then proceed to enhancing the code of this applications with a better exceptions handling and review the same exceptions and how the enhancements drastically improved our ability to identify and resolve the problems.\n\nTowards the end we'll also address the issue of exceptions publishing by presenting a few simple tools that can be developed to allow for a better notification and investigation of occurring exceptions.

Majority of the developers I met in the recent years really can’t tell how Object Oriented Concepts are reflected in their Company Web App Architecture, Why? Because common modern web apps are sadly, functional by design.\n\nThe Functional Code Flow Web Apps, with no solid architecture which became dominant in the last years pushed by Spring, and the .NET Solutions has many disadvantages when we write Enterprise Scale, Long Lasting Web Application. \n\nMany of those disadvantages can be overcome by writing an Object Oriented web application.\n\nThe change is already taking place. A new wave is emerging led by world class experts such as Vaughn Vernon, Eric Evans, Greg Young, Jimmy Bogard, Udi Dahan and behind them we can now see seeds by Java Spring and the Enterprise .Net Ecosystem.\n\nWhat are those disadvantages? What is an Object Oriented web application?\nMy talk will be answering those questions exactly.\n\nIn Short, Object Oriented Web Application is based on Domain Driven Design guidelines specified by the experts I mentioned above and are focused on their implementation in a Web Application.\n\nAs for the disadvantages - The biggest one is a Spaghetti code; I’m sure many of you experienced developers who have worked once or twice in their career on a web application has seen - Yep all the layers where in place, the IoC Container was there also, many interfaces where introduced, Attributes were used and yet the code became Spaghetti over time, more and more conventions where added, Special people where needed when you encounter a problem in a certain code – “He is the only one who understand\\remember that piece of code”, it was becoming more and more complex to adopt to the new business and the rest you probably know by now.\n\nTo demonstrate more, I’ll use some questions:\n\n-YOU\\IT SHOULD-\nCan you easily answer where each code or behavior should be located at?\nDoes the code struggles when you make a mistake? \nDoes your code promote Loose Coupling and Maintain Single Responsibility?\nDoes your Code open to new changes and can be easily modified (Agile way) and controlled in the long run?\nCan you reuse a business Behavior easily?\nWhere do Constructors disappear and how can I tell if my object is fully initialized and ready for use?\nHow do we start using visibility modifiers? \n\n-- YOU SHOULDN'T--\nDo you need to be familiar with frameworks bits and bytes in order to get it right?\nDo you need to remember anything by heart?\nDo you have methods that multiple business processes runs into them and are separated by many Boolean conditions?\n\nYou probably say to yourself, Yep, OO can solve this stuff but the question remains why are you not practicing that in your web application?\n\nBottom line - What I want?\n\nShare with you the Web Application Domain Driven Design concepts.

It takes us back to our childhood, while bringing back the lost dimensions of intuition and authenticity lacking from our day to day interactions.\n\nDuring the session, we'll also talk about a handful of projects created by us and others, try to figure out the larger scheme of things and will mostly try to share the immense passion we have towards physical computing.\n","comments":[],"createdAt":{"$date":"2013-12-30T11:31:38.194Z"},"speaker_ids":["vApzsq4N8RwKo4bPT"],"status":"maybe next time","tags":["hardware"],"title":"Title: Going Physi-Digy: One Way Road","type":"full","user_id":"vApzsq4N8RwKo4bPT","votes":{"45u5aboDGmr7kBvKP":true,"4iWrdsGWJa8y6Ln9t":true,"E2Xqkcvz4wQCBXGxz":true,"Huq3LdXfCuzH2R7r2":true,"JwJceFbf4GaZj22gT":true,"LJaD7A42TnMXh2QpX":true,"LKhGcHmLAFBX9cBSX":true,"NFkKGsEdpt52LZTZF":true,"Q4aeDXRbHyfYdFy6Q":true,"aqmiGHrg9sCPNJnpw":true,"cA7eBLqY7E5tYnXRT":true,"fBc97FkLoaQqDpw55":true,"gWt5bYgY3XzQa3j5M":true,"hqx45WhZ5NsZWnRvZ":true,"oKkRfepKdNZfdK9Jd":true,"oNmLgDYDC7X8RFas5":true,"oP9chAeJ2HEzSqBek":true,"qEGtvuniyse9DdkLJ":true,"qiHwDyucw9QFybw4P":true,"wnPapSdNsF5ZrLSs5":true}}
{"_id":"xT25RnD4ghfCMB9jc","abstract":"Being a professional developer requires staying up-to-date all the time.\nTime is a very precious resource for us. We need to learn new programming-languages, technologies, \nkeep the knowledge we already have, while being expected to work fast and produce high-quality results.\n\nWe frequently find ourselves with the feeling we work slower than we could. Whether its over-googling\nfor things we did dozens of times in the past, using too much the mouse instead of alternative keyboard shortcuts\nor searching for that famous Github repository we know exists but having hard time remembering its name.\n\nOur brain has a cache too. In this talk we will tackle various techniques of how to increase dramatically our cache's hits\nand work faster and more productive\n\nwe will address these main issues:\n1. How to learn a new programming-language/lib faster and better?\n2. How to remember more keyboard-shortcuts in less time?\n3. How to learn from technical mistakes encountered during coding?
